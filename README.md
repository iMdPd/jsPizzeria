## 🚀 <a id="overview">Quick overview</a>

The page was developed using JavaScript functions and a Handlebars template. A page created in the SPA model is fully loaded only once, and then when navigating the page, elements are replaced by those that are characteristic of specific articles. Project presents a simple blog page with three columns. The first column contains a list of article links generated from the index.html file. The second one has the article number, author, and content of the article. Under the article, there's a list of tags belonging to the article. The third column contains a tag cloud based on the most frequently repeated tags. Depending on the number of occurrences, the size of the text in the tag cloud is calculated. The names of authors have the number of occurrences in brackets.
